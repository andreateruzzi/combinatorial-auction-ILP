# Solving Combinatorial Auction with Integer Programming 

In this repository it is implemented a way to write and solve **combinatorial auctions** in terms of **linear integer programs** and solve them through:
1. A greedy algorithm that achieves a theoretical $m^{0.5}$ proxy.
2. [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) solver for integer programs.

A complete deck of slides presenting the topic can be found at [github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction](https://github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction). This work was done as part of the course [20602-Algorithms](https://didattica.unibocconi.it/ts/tsn_anteprima.php?cod_ins=20602&anno=2021&IdPag=6352).
