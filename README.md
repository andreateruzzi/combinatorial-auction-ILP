# Solving Combinatarial Auction with Integer Programming 

In this repository it is implemented a way to write and to solve ***combinatarial auctions** in term of **linear integer programs** and solving them through:
1. A greedy algorithm that achieves a theoretical m^0.5 proxy.
2. [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) solver for integer programs.
A complete deck of slide presenting the topic can be foud at [github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction](https://github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction).
This work was done as part of the course [20602-Algorithms](https://didattica.unibocconi.it/ts/tsn_anteprima.php?cod_ins=20602&anno=2021&IdPag=6352) at Bocconi University.
